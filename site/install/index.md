There are two main methods to install Tin Can Linux to your system:

  - [The easy way](easy.html) via a rootfs tarball. This is similar to the installation
    procedure for Kiss Linux. (Note: not currently available)

  - [The hard way](hard.html) by bootstrapping the system yourself. This is useful if you
    want to install Tin Can Linux on an architecture other than x86-64 or if you
    want greater control over the installation procedure.

The easy way is not currently available since I haven't released a rootfs
tarball. If you want to try out Tin Can Linux in its current state, you must use
the hard way.
