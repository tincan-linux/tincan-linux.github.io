There are two main methods to install Tin Can Linux to your system:

  - [The easy way](easy) via a rootfs tarball. This is similar to the installation
    procedure for Kiss Linux. (Note: not currently available)

  - [The hard way](hard) by bootstrapping the system yourself. This is useful if you
    want to install Tin Can Linux on an architecture other than x86-64 or if you
    want greater control over the installation procedure.

The easy way is not currently available since I haven't released a rootfs
tarball. If you want to try out Tin Can Linux in its current state, you must use
the hard way.

And if you've already finished the installation, why not head over to [@/register](/register)
to become immortalized as a user of Tin Can Linux?
