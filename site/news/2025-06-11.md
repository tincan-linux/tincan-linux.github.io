Tin Can + Repology!                                                   06/11/2025

Tincan is being alived!

I have just merged a PR into Repology to get the Tin Can repos indexed by their
service (check it out: https://repology.org/repository/tincan). What does this
mean? Package updates, of course! I'll begin pushing updates to outdated
packages fairly soon, with the goal of working towards a more stable "release"
(remember that the distribution follows a rolling model, but because things can
break often, I've opted to mark stable "releases" via tags).

Arc has also been updated to include some bugfixes and a few last features. I'll
be (hopefully) pushing a stable release soon (hopefully with a better name since
Arc seems to be a pretty common one for a lot of things).

Finally, expect another Tin Can showcase sometime! I'm not sure when as it
depends a lot on how much time the other maintenance steps take, but be on the
lookout nevertheless!
