This is the wiki page for all things kernel configuration. This step of the
installation process can be quite tricky, so I'm aiming to fill this page with
all sorts of hints, tricks, and resources to get your kernel config working.

============================

If you're willing to comb through some wiki pages and documentation, I've found
these resources to be quite insightful. Some of the bigger points from these
pages may be covered in this wiki page, but especially for some of the finer
details I would like to refrain from reinventing the wheel.

Kernel configuration:
  - https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Kernel/Gentoo_Kernel_Configuration_Guide
  - https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable/chapter10/kernel.html
  - https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Category:Hardware
  - https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Category:Laptops

Firmware selection:
  - https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Linux_firmware
  - https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Microcode#Kernel_configuration
  - https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/postlfs/firmware.html

The Gentoo Wiki in particular has been one of the best resources thus far. If
you're stuck, I would encourage combing through some of those wiki pages, even
those not listed here, to see if there's anything that might help.
